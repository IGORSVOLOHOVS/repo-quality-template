"""How a branch name is classified.

Point 14 is the rule that has been wrong twice: first "never a fourth branch",
which forbade pull requests, and then a version that rejected every branch
Dependabot opened. Both times the rule was only exercised by running it against
a real repository, which is a slow way to find out.
