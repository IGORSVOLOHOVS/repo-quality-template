## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Issue templates with mandatory acceptance criteria, a pull-request template,
  and `CODEOWNERS` - the shape of a contribution, in the place GitHub reads it.
- `scripts/enforce_contribution_policy.py` and `contribution-policy.yml`:
  branch grammar, commit format, sign-off and the issue link, checked before a
  human is asked to read the diff.
- `scripts/generate_sbom.py`: a CycloneDX bill of materials, attached to every
  release with its own checksum.
- Strict `mypy` over `src/`, in the lint job.
- `.github/dependabot.yml`, weekly, for pip and for actions.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
- `docs/workflow.md` - issue to release, six steps.
- `docs/decisions.md` - the OpenSSF criteria this project deliberately does not
  meet, each with its reason.
- `docs/standards-comparison.md` - where the points came from, measured against
  the OpenSSF Best Practices Badge and Scorecard.

### Fixed

- The branch policy rejected every branch Dependabot opened. Point 21 asks for
  a bot that watches the dependencies and point 14 asks every branch to carry
  an issue number; a bot can do neither, so switching Dependabot on turned
  every pull request in the repository red. Bot prefixes are now a configured,
  opt-in class, with tests for all four classifications.
- `scripts/apply_template_to_repo.py` did not copy `check_before_push.py`, so a
  target repository was told to run a file it had not been given.
- The same script judged point 14 with its own copy of the rule, reading
  `git branch -a` without pruning, and reported stray branches that had been
  deleted when their pull request merged. It now calls
  `enforce_branch_policy.py`, so there is one implementation.

### Changed

- The standard is twenty-four points, not fourteen.
- Point 14 is now "three long-lived branches" rather than "three branches":
  work happens on a short-lived `<code>-<issue>/<type>/<slug>` branch that is
  deleted when its pull request merges. The old rule made a pull request
  impossible, and with it the review gate.
- `scripts/apply_template_to_repo.py` copies the new infrastructure and reports
  all twenty-four points.


## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- Text analysis domain layer (`quality_template.core`): tokenising, sentence
  counting, word frequencies, lexical diversity.
- Command line interface with table and JSON output.
- tkinter desktop window with live analysis as you type.
- Test suite covering the domain layer and the CLI, with a coverage floor of 85
  percent enforced by the build.
- Benchmarks for `analyse_text`, `tokenise` and `top_words`.
- CI on Ubuntu and Windows across Python 3.10 and 3.12: lint, format check,
  tests, secret scan, quality metrics, benchmarks.
- Release workflow producing a single-file executable, a zip and a SHA-256
  checksum for each, published as a GitHub Release on a `v*.*.*` tag.
- ISO/IEC 25010 assessment, with four characteristics measured automatically by
  `scripts/collect_quality_metrics.py`.
- Branch policy of exactly `release`, `dev` and `test`, enforced by CI.
- Secret scanning with `gitleaks` both in pre-commit and over full history in CI.
- `scripts/apply_template_to_repo.py` to roll this layout onto another project.
